# Dataism-model

10-phase AI system project.  
Includes verification tools, phases 1–10 code, and documentation.  

---

## 🚀 Current Status
- **Phases Completed:** Phase 1 + Phase 2 (in progress verification)  
- **Next Active Phase:** Phase 3 – engineers will start from here  
- **Hardware Environment:** NVIDIA 5090 GPU (local machine)  
- **Verification:** Dedicated verification tool required before merging any work  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The Dataism-model is designed as a **ChatGPT-style system** running fully on a local GPU.  
This project is structured into **10 Phases** for controlled development, scaling, and verification.  

---

## ✅ Verification Standards
Before any engineer can contribute, they must:  
1. **Pass the verification test** (building a working verification tool).  
2. **Push changes through GitHub repo** – no direct access to local system.  
3. Ensure all phases can be validated with **PASS/FAIL outputs** and logs.  

---

## 📂 Phases Breakdown (High Level)
- **Phase 1:** Core repo + environment setup  
- **Phase 2:** Verification tool prototype  
- **Phase 3:** Expanded verification + tool refinement  
- **Phase 4–8:** System scaling, self-improving loops, reinforcement, reasoning layers  
- **Phase 9:** Autonomous engineering capability (system can evolve itself)  
- **Phase 10:** Elite self-upgrading, ROI factory, and post-human scale  

---

## 📖 Contribution Rules
- All commits must be made via **pull requests**.  
- Verification tool must confirm results before merge.  
- Code must be modular and well-documented.  

---

## 🔑 Notes for Engineers
- Expected dedication: **30+ hours per week**.  
- Communication: Clear progress updates + verification logs.  
- Goal: Move fast but **never sacrifice verification and trust** in outputs.  

---

## 🏁 Vision
The end result will be a **self-evolving AI system** capable of natural language reasoning,  
autonomous upgrades, and ROI-driven decision making — running 24/7 on local GPUs.
